# Simple-Calculator-in-JSPServlet

# Objective
To create a web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations.

# Technologies Used
Java
JSP (JavaServer Pages)
Servlet
HTML


# Project Features
User Interface: Design a simple and user-friendly web interface for the calculator using HTML and CSS. You can create input fields, buttons for digits and operations, and a display area to show the result.

Servlet: Create a Servlet to handle user requests and perform the calculations. The Servlet should be responsible for parsing user input, executing the requested operation, and sending the result back to the JSP page.

JSP Page: Create a JSP page that serves as the calculator's user interface. The JSP page should contain HTML for the layout and form elements for user input. When users click buttons or submit the form, the JSP page should send the data to the Servlet for processing.

Operations: Implement the basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Error Handling: Implement error handling to deal with invalid input, such as dividing by zero or non-numeric input.
